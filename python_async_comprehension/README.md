# Python Async Comprehension Project

This project aims to help you understand and master asynchronous concepts in Python, including asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and coroutine management.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain without external help:

- **How to write an asynchronous generator**
  An `async def` function that uses `yield` to produce values asynchronously, allowing you to await without blocking execution.

- **How to use async comprehensions**
  A concise syntax to collect values from an asynchronous generator, using `async for` within a comprehension.

- **How to type-annotate asynchronous generators**
  Using `typing.AsyncGenerator` to specify the types of yielded values and sent values.

---

## File Descriptions

### 0-async_generator.py

- **async_generator()**: Coroutine that loops 10 times, asynchronously waits 1 second each iteration, then yields a random number between 0 and 10.

### 1-async_comprehension.py

- **async_comprehension()**: Coroutine that collects 10 numbers generated by `async_generator()` using async comprehension, and returns the list.

### 2-measure_runtime.py

- **measure_runtime()**: Coroutine that runs `async_comprehension()` 4 times concurrently using `asyncio.gather`, measures the total runtime, and returns it.

---

## Why is the total runtime approximately 10 seconds?

Each call to `async_comprehension()` takes about 10 seconds (10 iterations × 1 second wait). Running 4 calls **in parallel** keeps the total runtime close to 10 seconds instead of 40, thanks to the non-blocking, concurrent nature of coroutines.

## How to run the scripts

Here’s how to execute the test scripts:
